	<p> I'm a senior undergraduate at Caltech studying computer science and
	business economics management. For the past few years, I've been working with 
	<a href="http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/" style="color:#FF0000;"> Professor Anandkumar</a>
	and <a href="https://www.rmichaelalvarez.com/" style="color:#FF0000;"> Professor R. Michael Alvarez</a>
	to develop NLP (natural language processing) techniques for the study of social media
	discussions and online abuse. My research interests include information retrieval, 
	neural conversational agents, human-computer interaction, and reinforcement learning in the context of NLP.
